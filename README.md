The Inventory Management System is an inventory management web application built using the MERN stack. The app allows users to add, view, update, and delete products from their inventory. It also features an image upload functionality using Cloudinary to store and retrieve product images.

The front-end of the app is built using React, with Bootstrap used for styling. It features a responsive design and intuitive user interface.
